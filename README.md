# Sixp
Six-Piece Chess

This is a board game with simple rules that was played for fun when I was a child. Then I made it into a computer game in the summary of 2011.

It is written in HTML5/Javascript. It makes use of HTML canvas and local storage.

The AI uses minimax strategy with alpha-beta prunning. AI code is not included here. AI is made a web service
available at http://homecox.com/services/sixp/. See http://homecox.com/services/sixp/README for more details.

Put this code in a web server, you will be able to visit and play.

Enjoy!
