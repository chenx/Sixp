# Sixp
Six-Piece Chess

This is a board game with simple rules that was played for fun when I was a child. Then I made it into a computer game in the summary of 2011.

It is written in HTML5/Javascript. It makes use of HTML canvas and local storage.

It runs in a browser (Firefox, Chrome, Safari, Opera, IE) as well as on mobile phone (Android, iOS, others may work but not tested).

The AI uses minimax strategy with alpha-beta prunning. AI code is not included here. AI is made a web service
available at http://homecox.com/services/sixp/. See http://homecox.com/services/sixp/README for more details.

The code here supports human/computer and computer/computer play. A live version is available at http://cssauh.com/sp. 
Remote human/human play is developed in 2015, but the code is not available here at this time.

Put this code in a web server, you will be able to visit and play.

Enjoy!
